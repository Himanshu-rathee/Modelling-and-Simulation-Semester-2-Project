# Modelling-and-Simulation-Semester-2-Project

Simulated traffic on a 3 km 3 lane highway using the Simpy library by creating vehicles with variables speeds, designs and overtaking features.

There are three files in the repository and all are coded in python. 
Step 1 file has simulation of vehicles with variable speed and overtaking features.
Step 2 file has different model of vehicles.
Step 3 file has one of the three 3 km lanes end at 2 km.
